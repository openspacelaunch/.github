# Open Space Launch Foundation

## Our Mission
To empower and accelerate student-led space projects across the Middle East and Africa, with the UK setting the benchmark for innovation and collaboration.

## Democratizing Space Launch Technology
Open Space Launch Foundation is developing OpenSASI - the world's first open-source launch vehicle development platform, making space exploration accessible to all.

## A Word from Our Founder
As a child, I dreamed of exploring new worlds under the stars. Today, I recognise that democratising access to space is a monumental challenge that may take a lifetime or more to achieve fully. Yet, with unwavering dedication, I founded the Open Space Launch Foundation to make that dream a reality for everyone, not just powerful nations and billionaires.

Leveraging my background in Simulation Engineering, AI, and Data Science at Elsevier and PlayStation and collaboration with esteemed teams like UCL Rocket and Sheffield University Sunride, we are laying the foundations for a future where space exploration is not just a privilege for a few but an opportunity for all.

Our flagship project, OpenSASI, is the world's first open-source launch vehicle development platform featuring high-performance physics and thermochemistry simulation with procedural CAD models optimised for manufacturing with robots in a garage. Starting with propulsion, we are expanding into vehicle and test facility development and, ultimately, mission control. We are creating a collaborative environment through digital twinsâ€”imagine GitHub, Kaggle, Wikipedia, and Thingiverse united but for space!

With the support of over 140 Kickstarter backers, 2000 newsletter subscribers, and 5000 social media followers, we are focused and building. Join us in making a difference! Together, we will realise the democratisation of space exploration and turn the impossible into the inevitable.

## Our Objectives
1. Develop Open Student-Amateur Space Initiative (OpenSASI)
   Create a distributed system comprised of integrated open-source software and hardware to revolutionize space exploration:
   - Design and manufacture space launch vehicles and supporting systems
   - Design and operate space launch missions
   - Collect data from simulations, tests, and mission operations
   - Analyze and integrate data to improve designs and decision-making
   - Enable collaboration via data and knowledge sharing
   - Leverage contemporary research, AI, and robotics
   - Boost safety, reliability, and cost efficiency in space exploration
2. Rally Amateur and Student Projects
Encourage and support amateur and student space launch projects to use and contribute to OpenSASI, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for space exploration enthusiasts.
3. Accelerate Space Programs
Empower amateur and student space programs to achieve ambitious goals, including payload orbital insertion, trans-lunar missions, and interplanetary exploration.
