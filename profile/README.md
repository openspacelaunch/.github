# Open Space Launch

## Democratizing Space Launch Technology
Open Space Launch is developing OpenSASI, the world's first open-source launch vehicle development platform, to make space exploration accessible to all.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to empower students and hobbyists worldwide to launch space missions collaboratively, particularly in nurturing talent and opportunities in the Middle East and Africa. Under the guidance of UK leadership, we are dedicated to making space exploration a safe, inclusive, and exciting frontier for anyone.

## Our Objectives
1. Develop Open Student-Amateur Space Initiative (OpenSASI)
   Create a distributed system comprised of integrated open-source software and hardware to revolutionize space exploration:
   - Design and manufacture space launch vehicles and supporting systems
   - Design and operate space launch missions
   - Collect data from simulations, tests, and mission operations
   - Analyze and integrate data to improve designs and decision-making
   - Enable collaboration via data and knowledge sharing
   - Leverage contemporary research, AI, and robotics
   - Boost safety, reliability, and cost efficiency in space exploration
2. Rally Amateur and Student Projects
Encourage and support amateur and student space launch projects to use and contribute to OpenSASI, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for space exploration enthusiasts.
3. Accelerate Space Programs
Empower amateur and student space programs to achieve ambitious goals, including payload orbital insertion, trans-lunar missions, and interplanetary exploration.
